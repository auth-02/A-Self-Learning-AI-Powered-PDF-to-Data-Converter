# A-Self-Learning-AI-Powered-PDF-to-Data-Converter

AI-powered PDF to data converter designed to extract information from PDF documents and convert it into structured data. This project offers two methods of extraction: one that retrieves all data in JSON format and another that extracts data according to predefined business use cases, also provided in JSON format. Additionally, it provides insights on schema-based extracted data after converting it into a data frame. The extraction process utilizes GROQ with Mistral LLM for enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
